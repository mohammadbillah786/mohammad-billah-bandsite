        <h3>The Bees Knees</h3>
        <p>
          The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco,
          California. The band consists a dynamic lineup featuring two lead
          vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a keyboardist and a drummer. The
          band achieved its first commercial success as an unsigned act, drawing
          attention from their future manager. Having extensive experience
          working with both new and seasoned acts, the manager was confident the
          band could succeed even further with more support, pushing The Bees
          Knees to sign with a well known record label. From there, the band has
          soared, gaining international recognition and ranking in the top 10 on
          the Poster Charts. New fans immediately fell in love with the band’s
          original and organic attitude, solidifying their place as one of the
          hottest and fastest up and coming acts of this century. Fans
          affectionately refer to themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to
          their candid and authentic performances on stage. The Bees Knees are
          currently recording their second studio album, looking to be released
          in early 2024.
