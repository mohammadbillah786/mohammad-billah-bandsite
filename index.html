          <p>
            The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco,
            California. The band consists a dynamic lineup featuring two lead
            vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a keyboardist and a drummer. The
            band achieved its first commercial success as an unsigned act, drawing
            attention from their future manager. Having extensive experience
            working with both new and seasoned acts, the manager was confident the
            band could succeed even further with more support, pushing The Bees
            Knees to sign with a well known record label.
          </p>
          <p>
            From there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition and
            ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans immediately fell
            in love with the band’s original and organic attitude, solidifying
            their place as one of the hottest and fastest up and coming acts of
            this century. Fans affectionately refer to themselves as “The Hive”
            and are drawn to their candid and authentic performances on stage. The
            Bees Knees are currently recording their second studio album, looking
            to be released in early 2024.
